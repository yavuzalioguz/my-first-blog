  <h3><a="">How is Possible to Know What I Want in My Life? Why did I start to learn how to code?</a></h3>
  <p>I have been thinking for years. I could not find it, yet. I will keep thinking. I still don't have the answer how it is possible but I think, rather it is true or false, the answer for now is that don't be scare to fail.
     I am target-oriented person, no doubt. When I see my target, If I want it, there have to be serious reason that can stop me.
     After I try different kind of jobs and different industries, the thing that I actually looking for is freedom. I think coding is freedom. I don't anything rather than wi-fi and my computer.
     Additionaly, I am a smart person, I love to solve problems. When I mix all the things that I have mentioned above and I decided to become software engineer.
     I have a great mentor, I wish myself to best luck.</p>
